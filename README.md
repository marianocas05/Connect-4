## Connect 4 AI Project
### Overview
This project focuses on developing an artificial intelligence (AI) to play Connect 4 using three different methods: Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), A*, and Minimax. The implementation of these methods was done without relying on external libraries, ensuring a deep understanding of each algorithm and its application to the game.

### Evaluation
Each AI method was rigorously tested to evaluate its performance in playing Connect 4. We compared their effectiveness, efficiency, and computational requirements, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Notably, while the A* and Minimax algorithms performed well, the MCTS implementation encountered issues and did not function as expected. Further debugging and refinement are needed for the MCTS method to work correctly.
